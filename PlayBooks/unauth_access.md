# 🔓 Unauthorized Access Investigation Playbook

This playbook provides step-by-step procedures for investigating unauthorized access incidents, with a focus on **brute force attacks** and **impossible travel alerts**. These are common indicators of credential compromise and account takeover attempts.

## 🎯 Purpose
A full investigation procedure for the two most common access-abuse alert types a SOC sees - brute force/credential stuffing and impossible-travel logins - carried from initial alert through to containment and closure.

## ⚙️ Function
Structured in parts: alert triage, brute-force-specific investigation, impossible-travel-specific investigation, and containment. Unlike `sop_phishing_analysis.md` (single-sitting, single-email SOP), this is the longer investigation you escalate into when triage confirms likely account compromise - including scenarios that started as a successful phish.

## 🏆 Goal
Correctly distinguish real account takeover from false positives (e.g., legitimate VPN use triggering impossible-travel), and produce MITRE ATT&CK-mapped (T1110 Brute Force, T1078 Valid Accounts) evidence sufficient to justify containment actions like forced password reset or account lockout.

## 📋 When to Use
- A SIEM, Azure AD, Okta, firewall, or VPN alert fires for repeated failed logins or geographically impossible login sequences
- Escalating from `sop_phishing_analysis.md` after a phish led to a successful credential capture
- Investigating a suspected credential-stuffing campaign against multiple accounts

## 🚨 Part 1: Alert Triage

### 1.1 Initial Alert Assessment

When an alert fires, gather the following information:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Alert Type** | Brute force or Impossible travel | `Multiple failed logins` |
| **Target Account** | Username/UPN affected | `jsmith@company.com` |
| **Source IP(s)** | Attacking IP address(es) | `185.234.72.19` |
| **Timestamp** | When the activity occurred | `2024-01-15 14:23:00 UTC` |
| **Authentication Method** | Protocol used | `RDP, OWA, VPN, SSH` |
| **Success/Failure** | Did any attempts succeed? | `47 failures, 1 success` |
| **Target System** | What was being accessed | `VPN Gateway, O365` |

### 1.2 Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Response Time |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Successful login after failures, privileged account, sensitive system | Immediate |
| **High** | Ongoing attack, multiple accounts targeted, executive account | < 1 hour |
| **Medium** | Failed attempts only, single account, non-sensitive system | < 4 hours |
| **Low** | Known scanner, honeypot trigger, non-production | < 24 hours |

### 1.3 Quick Triage Questions

Answer these to determine priority:

```
□ Did any authentication attempt succeed?
□ Is the targeted account privileged (admin, executive)?
□ Is the attack still ongoing?
□ Are multiple accounts being targeted?
□ Is the source IP internal or external?
□ Does the account have MFA enabled?
□ Has this account been compromised before?
□ Is there any post-authentication suspicious activity?
```

**If YES to any of the first four questions → Escalate immediately**

## 🔨 Part 2: Brute Force Investigation

### 2.1 Understanding Brute Force Attacks

| Attack Type | Description | Detection Pattern |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Traditional Brute Force** | Many passwords against one account | High failures, single user |
| **Password Spraying** | One password against many accounts | Low failures per user, many users |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Leaked credentials tested | Varied patterns, known breach data |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Common passwords tried | Sequential common passwords |

### 2.2 Data Collection

#### Windows Event Logs

```
Event ID 4625 - Failed logon
Event ID 4624 - Successful logon
Event ID 4771 - Kerberos pre-auth failed

```

**ELK/KQL Query - Failed Logins:**

```kql
winlog.event_id:4625 
| stats count() by winlog.event_data.TargetUserName, source.ip
| where count > 5
```

**Wazuh Query:**

```
rule.id:18106 OR rule.id:18107
```

#### Azure AD / Entra ID

**Sign-in Logs Location:**
- Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → Sign-in logs
- Or via Microsoft Graph API

**Key Fields:**
- `userPrincipalName`
- `ipAddress`
- `location`
- `status.errorCode`
- `status.failureReason`
- `clientAppUsed`
- `deviceDetail`

**Azure AD Error Codes:**

| Error Code | Meaning |

| where ResultType == "50126"
| summarize FailureCount=count(), 
            SuccessCount=countif(ResultType == 0),
            IPAddresses=make_set(IPAddress)
            by UserPrincipalName
| where FailureCount > 10
| sort by FailureCount desc
```

#### Linux/SSH

**Auth Log Location:** `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`

**grep for failed SSH:**

```bash
# Failed SSH attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 100

# Extract IPs with failure counts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | \
  awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Successful logins
grep "Accepted" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 50
```

**Splunk Query:**

```spl
index=linux sourcetype=linux_secure "Failed password"
| rex "from (?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"
| stats count by src_ip, user
| where count > 5
```

### 2.3 Source IP Analysis

For each attacking IP, investigate:

#### Step 1: Geolocation and Reputation

```bash
# Using command line
curl -s "https://ipinfo.io/185.234.72.19" | jq

# Check AbuseIPDB
curl -s "https://api.abuseipdb.com/api/v2/check?ipAddress=185.234.72.19" \
  -H "Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | jq

# Check VirusTotal
curl -s "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/ip_addresses/185.234.72.19" \
  -H "x-apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" | jq
```

**Online Tools:**
- [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [IPVoid](https://www.ipvoid.com/)
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)
- [GreyNoise](https://www.greynoise.io/)

#### Step 2: Document IP Intelligence

| Field | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| IP Address | |
| Country/City | |
| ISP/ASN | |
| Known VPN/Proxy? | |
| Known Tor Exit? | |
| Abuse Reports | |
| Threat Intel Match | |
| Historical Activity | |

#### Step 3: Check Internal Activity

Has this IP accessed anything else?

```spl
index=* src_ip="185.234.72.19" OR dest_ip="185.234.72.19"
| stats count by index, sourcetype, action
```

### 2.4 Account Analysis

For each targeted account:

#### Step 1: Account Information

```powershell
# Active Directory
Get-ADUser -Identity jsmith -Properties *

# Azure AD (PowerShell)
Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId jsmith@company.com | Format-List
```

**Document:**
- Account type (standard, admin, service)
- Department / Manager
- Last password change
- MFA status
- Group memberships
- Recent activity

#### Step 2: Check for Successful Compromise

**Did the attacker get in?**

```spl
# Windows - Success after failures from same IP
index=windows sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624 
  Account_Name="jsmith" Source_Network_Address="185.234.72.19"
| table _time, Account_Name, Logon_Type, Source_Network_Address
```

```kql
# Azure AD - Success after failures
SigninLogs
| where UserPrincipalName == "jsmith@company.com"
| where ResultType == 0
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| project TimeGenerated, IPAddress, Location, AppDisplayName, DeviceDetail
```

#### Step 3: Post-Compromise Activity

If successful login detected, investigate:

```spl
# All activity from compromised account
index=* user="jsmith" OR Account_Name="jsmith"
| timechart span=1h count by sourcetype
```

**Check for:**
- [ ] Email forwarding rules created
- [ ] Mailbox delegation changes
- [ ] Password reset attempts
- [ ] MFA changes
- [ ] OAuth app consents
- [ ] File access/downloads
- [ ] Lateral movement attempts
- [ ] Privilege escalation

### 2.5 Brute Force Investigation Checklist

```

## 🌍 Part 3: Impossible Travel Investigation

### 3.1 Understanding Impossible Travel

Impossible travel alerts trigger when a user authenticates from two geographic locations in a timeframe that makes physical travel impossible.

**Example:**
- Login from New York at 10:00 AM
- Login from Moscow at 10:30 AM
- Distance: ~4,600 miles
- Time elapsed: 30 minutes
- **Physically impossible**

### 3.2 Alert Context

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Time difference** | How far apart were the logins? |
| **Distance** | How far apart are the locations? |
| **Travel speed required** | Would require > 500 mph? |
| **VPN usage** | Corporate VPN can cause false positives |
| **Proxy/Anonymizer** | User may be using privacy tools |
| **Mobile device** | Could be traveling |
| **Shared account** | Multiple users on one account |

### 3.3 Data Collection

#### Azure AD Impossible Travel

**Azure Portal:**
1. Azure Active Directory → Security → Risky sign-ins
2. Filter by risk type: "Impossible travel"

**KQL Query:**

```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where RiskEventTypes_V2 contains "impossibleTravel"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location, 
          AppDisplayName, RiskLevelDuringSignIn, RiskDetail
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

**Get Full Context:**

```kql
let suspectUser = "jsmith@company.com";
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where UserPrincipalName == suspectUser
| project TimeGenerated, IPAddress, Location, City=tostring(LocationDetails.city),
          Country=tostring(LocationDetails.countryOrRegion),
          AppDisplayName, ClientAppUsed, DeviceDetail, ResultType
| sort by TimeGenerated asc
```

#### Okta Impossible Travel

**Okta System Log Query:**

```
eventType eq "user.session.start" and actor.alternateId eq "jsmith@company.com"
```

**Key Fields:**
- `client.ipAddress`
- `client.geographicalContext`
- `authenticationContext`
- `outcome.result`

#### On-Premises Systems

**VPN Logs:**

```spl
index=vpn user="jsmith"
| table _time, user, src_ip, src_country, action
| sort _time
```

**Correlate with other auth sources:**

```spl
index=* (user="jsmith" OR Account_Name="jsmith") 
  (EventCode=4624 OR action=success OR status=success)
| table _time, index, sourcetype, src_ip, action
| sort _time
```

### 3.4 Investigation Steps

#### Step 1: Map the Timeline

Create a timeline of all authentications:

| Time (UTC) | Location | IP Address | Application | Device | Result |
|------------|----------|------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 10:00:00 | New York, US | 203.0.113.50 | O365 | Windows/Chrome | Success |
| 10:30:00 | Moscow, RU | 185.234.72.19 | O365 | Unknown | Success |
| 10:32:00 | Moscow, RU | 185.234.72.19 | SharePoint | Unknown | Success |

#### Step 2: Calculate Travel Feasibility

```
Distance between locations: ~4,600 miles
Time between logins: 30 minutes
Required speed: 9,200 mph (impossible)
```

**Online Calculator:** [Distance Calculator](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distanceresult.html)

#### Step 3: Analyze Each Location

**Location 1 (Expected):**
- Is this the user's normal location?
- Is the IP from corporate network/VPN?
- Is the device known/managed?

**Location 2 (Suspicious):**
- Run IP through threat intelligence
- Check if VPN/Proxy/Tor
- Check device details
- Is this location associated with attacks?

#### Step 4: Contact the User

**Questions to ask:**

```
1. Were you traveling on [date]?
2. Do you use any VPN services (personal or corporate)?
3. Did you share your credentials with anyone?
4. Do you recognize a login from [location] at [time]?
5. Have you received any suspicious emails recently?
6. Did you click on any links or enter credentials anywhere unusual?
```

**Important:** Contact via known-good channel (phone call, in-person), not email.

#### Step 5: Determine Verdict

| Scenario | Verdict | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| User confirms using VPN | Benign | Document, tune detection |
| User was traveling with mobile | Benign | Document |
| User denies activity, unknown device | Compromised | Contain immediately |
| Corporate VPN caused both IPs | False Positive | Tune detection |
| User clicked phishing link | Compromised | Contain, investigate phishing |

### 3.5 Impossible Travel Investigation Checklist

```
INITIAL ASSESSMENT
□ Document both login locations and times
□ Calculate distance and required travel speed
□ Identify applications accessed from each location
□ Note device details for each login

LOCATION ANALYSIS
□ Analyze Location 1 (expected location)
  □ Corporate IP/VPN?
  □ Known device?
  □ Normal for this user?
□ Analyze Location 2 (suspicious location)
  □ IP reputation check
  □ VPN/Proxy/Tor?
  □ Device fingerprint
  □ Previous activity from this IP

USER VERIFICATION
□ Contact user via secure channel
□ Verify travel status
□ Confirm VPN usage
□ Review for phishing exposure

VERDICT DETERMINATION
□ Confirmed travel/VPN → False positive
□ Unknown activity, user denies → Compromise
□ User clicked phish → Compromise + phishing IR
```

query user /server:SERVER01

# Log off user
logoff <session_id> /server:SERVER01

# Reset Kerberos tickets (force re-auth)
klist purge -li 0x3e7
```

#### Block Attacking IP

**Firewall:**

```bash
# iptables
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 185.234.72.19 -j DROP

# Windows Firewall
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Attacker" -Direction Inbound -Action Block -RemoteAddress 185.234.72.19
```

**Azure AD Conditional Access:**
1. Create Named Location with attacking IP
2. Create Conditional Access policy blocking that location

### 4.2 Extended Containment

#### Check for Persistence

**Email Rules (Exchange Online):**

```powershell
# Check inbox rules
Get-InboxRule -Mailbox jsmith@company.com | Format-List Name, Description, Enabled, ForwardTo, RedirectTo, DeleteMessage

# Remove suspicious rules
Remove-InboxRule -Mailbox jsmith@company.com -Identity "Suspicious Rule Name"
```

**Mailbox Forwarding:**

```powershell

---

## 📊 Part 7: Detection Improvements

### 7.1 Brute Force Detection Rules

**Splunk Alert:**

```spl
index=windows sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
| bucket _time span=5m
| stats count by Account_Name, Source_Network_Address, _time
| where count > 10
| alert
```

**Azure Sentinel Analytics Rule:**

```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(5m)
| where ResultType == "50126"
| summarize FailureCount=count(), Accounts=make_set(UserPrincipalName) by IPAddress
| where FailureCount > 10
```

### 7.2 Impossible Travel Detection

**Azure Sentinel:**

```kql
let timeWindow = 60m;
let speedThreshold = 500; // miles per hour
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where ResultType == 0
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, 
          Latitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates.latitude),
          Longitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates.longitude)
| sort by UserPrincipalName, TimeGenerated asc
| extend prevTime = prev(TimeGenerated, 1),
         prevLat = prev(Latitude, 1),
         prevLon = prev(Longitude, 1),
         prevUser = prev(UserPrincipalName, 1)
| where UserPrincipalName == prevUser
| extend timeDiff = datetime_diff('minute', TimeGenerated, prevTime)
| where timeDiff < 60
// Calculate approximate distance (simplified)
| extend distance = sqrt(pow(Latitude - prevLat, 2) + pow(Longitude - prevLon, 2)) * 69
| extend speed = distance / (timeDiff / 60.0)
| where speed > speedThreshold
```

### 7.3 Recommendations

| Control | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **MFA** | Enforce MFA for all users, especially admins |
| **Conditional Access** | Block legacy auth, require compliant devices |
| **Password Policy** | Minimum 14 chars, ban common passwords |
| **Account Lockout** | 5 failures, 15-minute lockout |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time alerts on auth anomalies |
| **VPN Whitelisting** | Document known VPN IPs to reduce false positives |
| **User Training** | Phishing awareness, credential hygiene |
