## 🎯 Overview

This directory contains **resources, checklists, scripts, and methodologies** focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), generative AI (GenAI) and cybersecurity.

**What You’ll Find Here:**
- AI/ML use-case frameworks for threat detection, anomaly detection, and SOC automation  
- Generative AI and LLM (large language model) applications in security operations  
- Data-science workflows tailored to incident response, threat hunting, and red/blue operations  
- Checklists and templates for assessing AI/ML-powered security tools  
- Scripts, notebooks, or example configurations for integrating AI within security tooling  

### Purpose

These resources are designed to:
- Provide **methodology and structure** for integrating AI/ML in cybersecurity workflows  
- Offer **reusable assets** for scripting, modelling, and automating security tasks  
- Serve as **training and reference material** for cybersecurity practitioners expanding into AI/ML  
- Encourage **responsible use** of AI/ML in security contexts with appropriate governance and risk-management

## 📖 How to Use These Resources

### For Security Practitioners  
1. Identify your AI/ML objective (e.g., anomaly detection, automation).  
2. Select the relevant resource(s) from this folder.  
3. Adapt the workflows, scripts or checklists to your environment.  
4. Execute the model/workflow and document results.  
5. Review governance & ethical considerations once deployed.  

### For Trainers & Analysts  
- Use frameworks and checklists as teaching aids.  
- Walk teams through AI/ML use‐cases, prompt design, and governance.  
- Assign notebooks and scripts for hands‐on labs.  

### For Red/Blue Teams  
- Explore how AI/ML can enhance capabilities (e.g., automating reconnaissance, generating adversary scenarios).  
- Use the resources to test and validate AI/ML integrated security tools.  

### Customization Tips  
- **Adapt to your tooling**: Insert your internal data sets, telemetry, and platforms.  
- **Track versioning**: Note model versions, data cut‐offs, and change logs.  
- **Embed links**: Include links to internal playbooks or SOC frameworks.  
- **Risk-focus**: Prioritize items by risk and impact.
