## 🔎 What is OSINT?

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is the collection and analysis of information gathered from publicly available sources. OSINT is used for:

- **Cybersecurity**: Threat intelligence, vulnerability research, attack surface mapping
- **Penetration Testing**: Reconnaissance phase of security assessments
- **Incident Response**: Threat actor attribution and IOC correlation
- **Corporate Security**: Due diligence, brand protection, competitive analysis
- **Law Enforcement**: Investigations and intelligence gathering
- **Research**: Academic and investigative journalism

### Core Principles

✅ **Publicly Available**: Only collect information accessible to the public  
✅ **Legally Obtained**: No hacking, unauthorized access, or circumvention  
✅ **Ethically Collected**: Respect privacy laws and terms of service  
✅ **Properly Documented**: Maintain chain of custody and source attribution

## Security, Legal, and Ethical Considerations ⚠️

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Legal and Ethical OSINT Use Only

**OSINT involves collecting publicly available information - but "public" does NOT mean "unrestricted use."**

### Legal Framework & Compliance

**ALWAYS comply with applicable laws:**

#### United States
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**: Prohibits unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access to computer systems
- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)**: Protects electronic communications and stored data
- **State Privacy Laws**: Many states have additional privacy and anti-stalking statutes
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Regulates collection and use of California residents' data

#### European Union
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Strict regulations on personal data processing
  - Applies to EU residents' data regardless of investigator location
  - Requires lawful basis for data processing
  - Includes "right to be forgotten" and data minimization principles

#### International
- Laws vary significantly by jurisdiction
- Some countries restrict OSINT activities more strictly than others
- Cross-border investigations may trigger multiple legal frameworks

### Terms of Service (ToS) Compliance
```
⚠️ Violating website Terms of Service can result in:
- Legal action from the website operator
- Account termination and IP bans
- Civil lawsuits for damages
- Potential CFAA violations in some cases
```

**Many websites explicitly prohibit:**
- Automated scraping or data collection
- Creating fake accounts or misrepresentation
- Accessing data through unauthorized means
- Commercial use of collected data

**ALWAYS review and comply with ToS before collecting data from any platform.**

### Ethical Guidelines for OSINT Practitioners

#### Core Principles

1. **Respect Privacy**: Collect only what is necessary for your legitimate purpose
2. **Do No Harm**: Consider the potential consequences of your investigation
3. **Transparency**: Understand who you're working for and why
4. **Legal Compliance**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations
5. **Professional Standards**: Maintain objectivity, accuracy, and integrity
6. **Data Minimization**: Collect the minimum information needed
7. **Proper Storage**: Protect collected data from unauthorized access
8. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report security issues through proper channels

#### Before Starting Any Investigation

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I have legal authority or authorization for this investigation?
- What is my legitimate purpose for collecting this information?
- Am I respecting individual privacy and dignity?
- Could my actions cause harm to individuals or organizations?
- Am I complying with all applicable laws and regulations?
- Am I following ethical guidelines for my profession?
- Would I be comfortable if my methods were made public?

---

### Operational Security (OPSEC) Requirements

**Protect yourself and your investigation:**

#### Network Security
- ✅ **ALWAYS use VPN or Tor** for OSINT activities
- ✅ Use dedicated networks separate from personal/corporate
- ✅ Employ VM snapshots for clean investigative states
- ✅ Rotate IP addresses and user agents regularly

#### Identity Protection
- ✅ Use burner accounts for social media reconnaissance
- ✅ Never use personal accounts for investigations
- ✅ Create detailed, believable sock puppet personas
- ✅ Use separate email addresses for each persona
- ✅ Use virtual phone numbers (never personal numbers)

#### Data Security
- ✅ Encrypt all collected investigation data
- ✅ Use secure storage with access controls
- ✅ Maintain proper chain of custody for evidence
- ✅ Securely delete data when no longer needed
- ✅ Follow data retention policies and regulations

---

### Documentation & Evidence Handling

**Proper documentation is essential:**

#### Required Practices
- 📝 Screenshot everything with timestamps
- 📝 Archive web pages (archive.is, Wayback Machine)
- 📝 Record video for dynamic content
- 📝 Log all commands and queries used
- 📝 Document sources for all information
- 📝 Calculate and verify file hashes
- 📝 Maintain detailed investigation notes
- 📝 Preserve metadata where relevant

#### Chain of Custody
- Maintain unbroken documentation of evidence handling
- Use write-blockers for forensic data
- Store multiple copies in different locations
- Follow proper legal procedures for evidence preservation

---

### International Considerations

**OSINT crosses borders - laws vary:**

- 🌍 **Jurisdiction Matters**: Different countries have different privacy laws
- 🌍 **Data Protection**: EU GDPR, UK DPA, Brazil LGPD, etc.
- 🌍 **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect cultural norms and expectations
- 🌍 **Legal Authority**: Some techniques legal in one country may be illegal in another
