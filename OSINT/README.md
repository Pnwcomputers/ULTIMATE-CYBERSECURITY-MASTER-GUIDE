## 🔎 What is OSINT?

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is the collection and analysis of information gathered from publicly available sources. OSINT is used for:

- **Cybersecurity**: Threat intelligence, vulnerability research, attack surface mapping
- **Penetration Testing**: Reconnaissance phase of security assessments
- **Incident Response**: Threat actor attribution and IOC correlation
- **Corporate Security**: Due diligence, brand protection, competitive analysis
- **Law Enforcement**: Investigations and intelligence gathering
- **Research**: Academic and investigative journalism

### Core Principles

✅ **Publicly Available**: Only collect information accessible to the public  
✅ **Legally Obtained**: No hacking, unauthorized access, or circumvention  
✅ **Ethically Collected**: Respect privacy laws and terms of service  
✅ **Properly Documented**: Maintain chain of custody and source attribution

## Security, Legal, and Ethical Considerations ⚠️

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Legal and Ethical OSINT Use Only

**OSINT involves collecting publicly available information - but "public" does NOT mean "unrestricted use."**

### Legal Framework & Compliance

**ALWAYS comply with applicable laws:**

#### United States
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**: Prohibits unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access to computer systems
- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)**: Protects electronic communications and stored data
- **State Privacy Laws**: Many states have additional privacy and anti-stalking statutes
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Regulates collection and use of California residents' data

#### European Union
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Strict regulations on personal data processing
  - Applies to EU residents' data regardless of investigator location
  - Requires lawful basis for data processing
  - Includes "right to be forgotten" and data minimization principles

#### International
- Laws vary significantly by jurisdiction
- Some countries restrict OSINT activities more strictly than others
- Cross-border investigations may trigger multiple legal frameworks

### Terms of Service (ToS) Compliance
