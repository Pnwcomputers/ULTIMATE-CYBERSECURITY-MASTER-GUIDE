## Firmware Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (`esptool`, `pyserial`), USB drivers (CH340/CP210x), and `git`.

### Getting the Firmware

- **Stable Release (v1.8.9):** Use the release assets for your board (v4/v6/v6.1/v7/Kit/Mini/Flipper/MultiBoard S3/CYD/M5 Cardputer/**ESP32-C5 DevKit**, etc.).  
- The release page lists exact **binary names** per hardware.

### Flashing Methods

1) **Web Flasher** – via browser serial tools.  
2) **Marauder Flasher (Windows)** – GUI flasher.  
3) **`esptool.py`** – cross-platform CLI (erase + write at `0x10000`, or full layout).  
4) **Arduino IDE** – for development (boards manager + required libraries).

**New in v1.8.9 – On-device self-update picker:** You can **select a `.bin` file from a list** on the device to flash, handy when keeping multiple builds on SD.

### Initial Configuration

- Serial @ 115200 for boot logs and menu.  
- Menu: WiFi (Scan/Attack/Sniff/AP/General), Bluetooth (Scan/Spam/**AirTag Monitor**), GPS (Data/**POI**), Settings/Device, Reboot.  
- AirTag Monitor and GPS menus appear only when supported by hardware.

- Sniffers: Beacons, Probes, PMKID, PCAP.  
- **Service Discovery & Quick Triage (1.8.x):** **ARP scan**, **SSH scan**, **Telnet scan**, and **new port-scan presets** help quickly profile targets before pivoting to full tools.

### Attacks

- **Deauth** (targeted/broadcast), **Beacon/Probe floods**, Evil Twin/Captive Portal, Rickroll/“Funny SSIDs”.  
- **Association Sleep Attack (1.8.x):** low-airtime association/roaming stress pattern for scoped testing.

## Bluetooth & BLE Operations

### AirTag Monitor (v1.8.9)

**Purpose:** Detect nearby **Apple AirTags** and track **Last-Seen** timing to identify potential trackers persisting around test subjects or areas.  
**Menu:** `Bluetooth → AirTag Monitor`  
**Output:** device ID, RSSI, **Last-Seen** (hh:mm:ss).  
**Field Use:** Walk the route and watch **Last-Seen** shrink/grow; combine with **GPS POIs** to flag recurring spots.

---

## GPS & Wardriving Integration

- GPS wiring (NEO-6M/8M/M9N), TinyGPS++ setup, and logging.  
- **POI Markers:** mark locations during wardrives (e.g., suspicious SSIDs, repeated trackers) for post-processing maps.  

**Data Formats:** KML, WiGLE CSV, and custom JSON.  
**Visualization:** Folium heatmaps; stats (open/WEP/WPA2/WPA3 counts, channel distribution, top OUIs).

---

## Detection & Defense Strategies

- IDS rules for deauth/beacon floods.

- Hardening (802.11w PMF, isolation).  
- Client protections (Windows/macOS/Linux).  
- Incident response and containment workflow.

**New BLE Indicator (v1.8.9):** consider **AirTag beacon** patterns and **Last-Seen** trends as contextual indicators during blue-team exercises.

---

## Legal Framework & OPSEC

- **Authorization templates**, scope boundaries, data handling, chain of custody.  
- **OPSEC:** MAC randomization, hostname obfuscation, encrypted storage, secure deletion.  
- **5 GHz (ESP32-C5):** obey DFS/regional RF laws.

---

## Troubleshooting & Optimization

- Boot/flash/display/SD fixes, compilation errors, and SD mount issues.  
- Performance tuning (heap/PSRAM, power management).  
- **GPS Menu Visibility:** shows only when module attached (1.8.9).  
- **Self-Update Bin Picker:** select `.bin` file directly from SD (1.8.9).
