```
⚠️ LEGAL AND ETHICAL USE ONLY ⚠️

These security checklists contain attack techniques and methodologies for:

✅ AUTHORIZED USES:
   • Penetration testing with explicit written authorization
   • Red team operations with organizational approval
   • Security assessments with client permission
   • Blue team training and detection development
   • Purple team exercises in controlled environments
   • Security research in isolated lab environments
   • Educational purposes with proper supervision
   • CTF competitions and authorized challenges

🚫 STRICTLY PROHIBITED:
   • Unauthorized penetration testing or "hacking"
   • Attacking systems without explicit written permission
   • Exceeding authorized scope of engagement
   • Testing techniques on production systems without approval
   • Using attack techniques for malicious purposes
   • Bypassing security controls without authorization
   • Causing harm, disruption, or data loss
   • Any illegal or unethical activities
```

---

### Legal Requirements for Security Testing

#### Written Authorization Requirements

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS obtain written authorization that explicitly includes:**
- ✅ Specific systems, networks, and IP ranges in scope
- ✅ Testing methodology and techniques approved
- ✅ Time windows for testing activities
- ✅ Out-of-scope systems and explicit restrictions
- ✅ Emergency contact information and escalation
- ✅ Data handling and confidentiality requirements
- ✅ Liability, indemnification, and insurance terms
- ✅ Deliverables, reporting requirements, and format

#### Scope Boundaries

```
✅ IN SCOPE (With Explicit Authorization):
   • Systems explicitly listed in engagement letter
   • Networks defined in written agreement
   • Specific techniques approved by client
   • Test accounts created for engagement
   • Designated time windows only

🚫 OUT OF SCOPE (Even If Discovered):
   • Third-party systems or cloud services
   • Production systems not explicitly authorized
   • Personal devices of employees
   • Partner or vendor systems
   • Anything not explicitly in writing
   • Techniques not approved (e.g., DoS, destructive)
```

#### Rules of Engagement

**Essential Guidelines for Attack Technique Testing:**

1. **Stop Immediately if Uncertain**: If scope is ambiguous, STOP and get clarification
2. **Report Critical Vulns Immediately**: Don't wait for final report if system is at risk
3. **No Destructive Actions**: Unless explicitly authorized (ransomware, wipers, etc.)
4. **No Denial of Service**: Unless specifically approved and planned
5. **Data Protection**: Never exfiltrate, modify, or delete real production data
6. **Communication Protocol**: Use established secure channels for updates
7. **Social Engineering Limits**: Respect agreed boundaries (no physical threats, etc.)
8. **Physical Access**: Only if specifically authorized in writing
9. **Time Windows**: Test only during approved times
10. **Document Everything**: Every command, technique, and finding

### Attack Technique Legal Considerations

#### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) - United States

```
⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL WARNING:

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030) criminalizes:
   • Unauthorized access to protected computers
   • Exceeding authorized access
   • Damaging protected computers
   • Trafficking in passwords
   • Extortion involving computers

PENALTIES:
   • Up to 10 years imprisonment (first offense)
   • Up to 20 years (repeat offense)
   • Significant financial penalties
   • Civil liability in addition to criminal charges

CRITICAL: Authorization must be:
   ✓ Explicit and in writing
   ✓ From someone with authority to grant it
   ✓ Specific about scope and techniques
   ✓ Current and not expired
```

#### International Laws

- **UK Computer Misuse Act 1990**: Unauthorized access is criminal offense
- **EU Cybercrime Directives**: Harmonized computer crime laws across EU
- **Canada Criminal Code Section 342.1**: Unauthorized computer use
- **Australia Cybercrime Act 2001**: Computer-related offenses

**Key Point**: These laws apply even when using the techniques in these checklists
without proper authorization.
