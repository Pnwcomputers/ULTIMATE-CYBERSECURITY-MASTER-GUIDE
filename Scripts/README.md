## 🎯 Overview

This directory contains **security automation scripts, penetration testing tools, and utility programs** written in multiple programming languages. These scripts are designed for authorized security testing, research, and educational purposes.

### 🔴 CRITICAL WARNING

```
⚠️ THESE ARE OFFENSIVE SECURITY TOOLS ⚠️

Many scripts in this collection are PENETRATION TESTING and EXPLOITATION tools.
Unauthorized use is a FEDERAL CRIME with severe penalties including imprisonment.

YOU MUST have explicit written authorization before running ANY of these scripts
against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

Using these tools without authorization violates:
• Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) - Up to 10 years imprisonment
• State computer crime laws
• International cybercrime laws
• Organizational policies

   └─> Understand exactly what each script does
   └─> Prepare monitoring and logging
   └─> Have rollback procedures ready
   └─> Coordinate with stakeholders

3. Execution Phase:
   └─> Follow authorized scope strictly
   └─> Document all commands and outputs
   └─> Monitor system impact continuously
   └─> Stop immediately if issues occur
   └─> Maintain communication with client

   └─> Firewall rules preventing external access

3. Target Systems:
   └─> Intentionally vulnerable VMs (Metasploitable, DVWA)
   └─> Your own purpose-built test systems
   └─> CTF platform environments
   └─> Cloud-based lab subscriptions (HTB, THM)

4. Snapshots & Backups:
   └─> Snapshot before testing
   └─> Easy rollback if issues occur
   └─> Keep clean baseline snapshots
   └─> Regular backups of configurations
```
