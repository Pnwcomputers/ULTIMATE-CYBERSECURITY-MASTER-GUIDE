═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
          CRITICAL: "Without Authorization" Includes:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✗ No authorization at all (hacking into systems)
✗ Exceeding authorized access (going beyond permissions)
✗ Authorization obtained through fraud
✗ Authorization expired or terminated
✗ Authorization limited but exceeded
✗ Authorization from unauthorized person

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Key CFAA Definitions:**

**"Protected Computer"** = Nearly ALL computers:
- Government computers
- Financial institution computers
- Computers used in or affecting interstate commerce (essentially all internet-connected computers)
- Computers used by the federal government

**"Exceeding Authorized Access"** = Accessing a computer with authorization but obtaining information beyond what you're authorized to access

**"Damage"** = Any impairment to integrity or availability of data, programs, systems, or information

**CFAA Civil Liability:** In addition to criminal penalties, victims can sue for civil damages, including:
- Economic damages
- Equitable relief

## 🌍 International Legal Considerations

### Cross-Border Attacks

**Key Principle**: **Where the victim is located** often determines jurisdiction, NOT where the attacker is located.

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1**: You're in the USA, attack a system in the UK
- **UK Law Applies**: Computer Misuse Act 1990
- **US Law Applies**: CFAA (using US computer systems to commit offense)
- **Result**: Subject to prosecution in BOTH jurisdictions

**Scenario 2**: You're in the UK, attack a US system
- **US Law Applies**: CFAA
- **UK Law Applies**: Computer Misuse Act (using UK internet connection)
- **Result**: Subject to prosecution in BOTH jurisdictions

**Scenario 3**: You're in the USA, attack a system in Germany
- **German Law Applies**: German Criminal Code
- **US Law Applies**: CFAA
- **EU Law Applies**: GDPR (if personal data involved)
- **Result**: Subject to prosecution in multiple jurisdictions

---

### Extradition Treaties

**The United States has extradition treaties with over 100 countries**, including:
- All European Union member states
- Canada, Mexico
- Australia, New Zealand
- Japan, South Korea
- India (limited)
- Most South American countries

**Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs):**
- Facilitate evidence sharing between countries
- Support criminal investigations
- Enable prosecution even if extradition doesn't occur

**Recent Extraditions for Computer Crimes:**
- **Lauri Love** (UK → US): Fought extradition successfully, but faced charges in both countries
- **Kim Dotcom** (NZ): Fought US extradition for years
- **Marcus Hutchins**: Detained when visiting US
- **Julian Assange**: High-profile extradition case

**Key Point**: **You CANNOT hide from computer crime prosecution by being in another country**. Modern international cooperation means prosecution is likely regardless of location.

---

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

**Applies to**:
- Processing personal data of EU residents
- **Regardless of where the processor is located**
- Even if you're in the USA, Australia, Asia, etc.

**Personal Data Includes:**
- Names, email addresses, IP addresses
- Location data
- Online identifiers (cookies, device IDs)
- Any information that can identify an individual

**GDPR Violations Relevant to Repository Content:**
- Unauthorized collection of personal data (OSINT tools)
- Processing without legal basis
- Failure to implement security measures
- Data breaches without notification
- Transferring data outside EU without safeguards

**Penalties:**
- **Tier 1**: Up to €10 million or 2% of global annual revenue (whichever is higher)
- **Tier 2**: Up to €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue (whichever is higher)

**Example**: A company with $1 billion revenue faces potential GDPR fine of **$40 million** for serious violations.

**Criminal Prosecution**: Many EU member states have criminalized GDPR violations with additional imprisonment penalties.

---

### Data Protection Laws Worldwide

**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**:
- Applies to California residents' data
- Private right of action for data breaches
- Statutory damages: $100-$750 per consumer per incident

**Other US State Laws:**
- Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)
- Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)
- Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)
- Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
- Many more states enacting privacy laws

**International Data Protection:**
- **Brazil**: Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)
- **Canada**: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
- **Australia**: Privacy Act 1988
- **Japan**: Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI)
- **South Korea**: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)
- **India**: Digital Personal Data Protection Act

**Trend**: Global movement toward stronger data protection and privacy rights. Unauthorized security testing involving personal data faces increased legal risks worldwide.
